===========================================
TAGS --> Are used to group and run the feature files, and scenarios.
     -> We can group to include the scenarios, or we can group and exclude the
        scenario from running test suite.

    Which keywords we have for tags?
        - or : is similar to || from java.
        ex:
            -> tags = "@scenarioA or @scenarioB"
            -> if a scenario has either one of the given tags, it will be executed.

        - and : is similar to && from java.
            -> it wants to have the both sides of the condition to be true.
        ex:
            -> tags = "@scenarioA and @scenarioB"
            -> What this tag says is: "The scenario I want to execute MUST have both
                scenarioA tag AND scenarioB tag"
            -> If the scenario has only one of the tags above, it will NOT BE executed.
            -> Therefore, AND is used to be more specific with the selection of scenarios.

        - and not : similar to --> !&& in java
            -> If we want to exclude some scenarios we will be using "and not" keyword
            ex:
            -> "@scenarioA or @scenarioB and not @scenarioC"
            -> This statement will find and run any @scenarioA and @ScenarioB

            @scenarioA
    1-      Scenario: something1

            @scenarioB
    2-      Scenario: something2

            @scenarioA @scenarioC
    3-      Scenario: something3

            @scenarioA @scenarioB @scenarioC
    4-      Scenario: something4

    ex: "@scenarioA or @scenarioB and not @scenarioC"

    Which one of the scenarios will be ran with this statement?

    -> #3 (something3) is not running for sure.
    -> #1 will run
    -> #2 will run as well

    ex: "@scenarioA and @scenarioB and not @scenarioC"
    -> This statement will NOT execute any scenario from above example

    ex: "@scenarioA and @scenarioB"
    -> This statement will only run #4 from the above example.

======================================================================
BACKGROUND:
    -> If we have any repeating steps that applies to ALL OF THE scenarios in the SAME feature file.

    -> Does creating "background" in one feature file apply to the other feature files?
        - NO. It does not. It only applies to each scenario in the SAME feature file.

    -> Background is very similar to @BeforeMethod from TestNG. The steps we put under
     background will be applied to the following scenarios in the same feature file.

    -> When you want to use background, you need to make sure that steps you put
     under background applies to all of the scenarios in the same feature file.

======================================================================
HOOKS :
    -> Hooks class is used to create before and after conditions for each scenario
                and each step if we need to.
    -> We have different set of annotations that we can use in hooks class.

    All of the below are coming from CUCUMBER, NOT JUNIT.
    @Before     : Whatever condition we put here applies BEFORE each scenario.
            ex: setup anything that the test needs to run.
        -> webdriver setup, maximize browser, database connection setup

    @After      : Whatever condition we put here applies AFTER each scenario.
           ex: used for tearDown purposes.
            -> we can close any connection we opened, close driver, close browser

 @BeforeStep: Whatever condition/statement we put here will be applied before each step.
 @AfterStep : Whatever condition/statement we put here will be applied AFTER each step.
    EX: -> we can take screenshots before and after each step.
        -> we can time how long each step are taking

-> How does hook work without any inheritance or extending?
    -> the glue path is used to run Hooks class
    -> the class name is not important, but we need to make sure to get all of
        the annotations from CUCUMBER.

======================================================================================
PARAMETERIZATION :
    -> In simple terms, parameterization is just being able to pass test data to a
            scenario from feature files without having to go to step definitions.
    -> We can change the test data from feature file, and immediately run the feature
            with a new set of test data.
    -> We just avoid hard coding test data into our step definitions.

======================================================================================
    #3 - dataTables
        -> Cucumber allows us to pass multiple data under one step.
        -> We can accept that data and store it under many different categories such as, list, map...

     syntax:
        Given something is happening user should see all of the following
        |apple|
        |orange|
        |kiwi|
        |cucumber|

  --> Whatever data we pass on the feature file will always come from feature files as EXPECTED DATA
      -> It can be some list of links that we are trying to verify
      -> It can be some options from a dropdown that we are trying to verify
      -> it can be any set of data that we are trying to verify from the browser.
      -> We pass the expected data in feature file. Then we get the actual data from browser and we compare.
        ACTUAL IS COMING FROM BROWSER

========================================================
    Verify that on the google search page footer contains 6 links

SCENARIO OUTLINE:
    Scenario Outline is used to run the same scenario against different data sets
    How to achieve scenario outline:
        1- Use Scenario Outline keyword --> or Scenario Template
        2- Use diamond brackets in parameter outlines "<expectedValue>"
        3- Create examples and pass the outlines --> Examples or Scenarios
    Scenario Outline: Search functionality header verification
    When User searches "<searchValue>" in the wiki search page
    Then User should see "<expectedTitle>" in the wiki title
    Then User should see "<expectedMainHeader>" in the main header
    Then User should see "<expectedImageHeader>" in the image header
    Examples: example test data for wikipedia search
      | searchValue     | expectedTitle   | expectedMainHeader | expectedImageHeader |
      | Steve Jobs      | Steve Jobs      | Steve Jobs         | Steve Jobs          |
      | John Travolta   | John Travolta   | John Travolta      | John Travolta       |
      | Albert Einstein | Albert Einstein | Albert Einstein    | Albert Einstein     |
      | Keanu Reeves    | Keanu Reeves    | Keanu Reeves       | Keanu Reeves        |
      | Bruce Lee       | Bruce Lee       | Bruce Lee          | Bruce Lee           |
      | Dua Lipa        | Dua Lipa        | Dua Lipa           | Dua Lipa            |
      | Thomas Edison   | Thomas Edison   | Thomas Edison      | Thomas Edison       |
      | Sam Heughan     | Sam Heughan     | Sam Heughan        | Sam Heughan         |
