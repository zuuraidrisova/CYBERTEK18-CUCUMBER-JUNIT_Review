 Agenda: Selenium Grid

 Region: N. Virginia
 AMI name: cybertek_docker_grid

 Windows users please use git bash

Open terminal/powershell

Navigate to the folder with previously downloaded pem file

1. ONLY For MAC, WINDOWS USERS PLEASE DON'T RUN THIS COMMAND:

  	chmod 400 b18_key.pem

 This command makes file read only

 If you are getting error, for example: Operation is not permitted, execute command with sudo.

 	sudo chmod 400 b18_key.pem

Then, enter password. Password id invisible.

 2. For everyone:

Change root to ec2-user

 ssh -i "b18_key.pem" ec2-user@ec2-54-80-133-27.compute-1.amazonaws.com

after @, is your server address

cd folder name

cd .. go back to the parent folder

If it's asking you "Are you sure you want to continue?" - Enter yes, and hit Return/Enter

Navigate to downloads folder from everywhere
cd ~/Downloads

#To start selenium grid

	docker-compose up -d

#To stop

	docker-compose down


# To see list of running containers

docker container ps


http://ip_address_of_your_ec:4444/grid/console

*NOTE: make sure that port 4444 is opened. You can check on AWS console --> inbound rules

PLEASE DON'T SCALE SELENIUM GRID ON EC2 micro instance!

############################

Selenium Grid - is a tool for remote test execution. It allows to run tests on multiple
servers at the same time. Also, it provides cross platform and cross browser testing
capabilities.

Selenium Grid has 2 components: hub and node.

In the grid, there should be only one hub, but one or more nodes.

Hub and nodes can be located on the different servers.

Since Selenium Grid is a java program, it requires to install JDK, browsers and
 web drivers.

Why do we need a docker here?

Docker is used to run containers. Container is a lightweight VM that is running
 your program. Container has all required dependencies to run that program.
 For example: container for hub is based on linux OS and has JDK and selenium
 standalone jar file (for Selenium Grid file). Container for node has linux OS,
 JDK, chrome/firefox browser and selenium standalone jar file (for Selenium Grid file).

Docker allows quickly scale selenium grid infrastructure, u can easily change amount of browsers

docker-compose scale chrome=10

This command will create 10 containers with chrome based selenium grid nodes.

To run tests, we need to use RemoteWebdriver class and provide URL of selenium
grid hub and desired capabilities(chrome or firefox options) in our Driver utility class

ex:
case "firefox-remote":
                    try{

                        FirefoxOptions firefoxOptions = new FirefoxOptions();
                        URL url = new URL("http://54.87.102.95:4444/wd/hub");
                        driver = new RemoteWebDriver(url, firefoxOptions);

                    }catch (Exception e){

                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                    break;

Selenium Grid allows us to reduce test execution time. Regression suite must be
executed asap and our laptop performance is not enough for this. That's why,
we need to use a server, that we rent on AWS.
