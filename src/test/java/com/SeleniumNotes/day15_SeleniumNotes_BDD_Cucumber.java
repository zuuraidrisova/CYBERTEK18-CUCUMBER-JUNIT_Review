2 DAY'S SCHEDULE
#1 -> RECAP
#2 -> dryRun
#3 -> TAGS : How to group scenarios and manage running them?
#4 -> Background
#5 -> Hooks
#6 -> Parameterization
#7 -> data tables
#8 -> Scenario Outlines
#9 -> Parallel testing/reports

===============================================================================

#1 -> RECAP

--> Tell me about your framework?

-> Java
-> Selenium
-> Maven -> pom.xml -> dependencies
-> Singleton design pattern
-> Page object model design pattern
-> Cucumber to make our framework BDD (Behavior Driven)
-> Gherkin language in feature files
-> Data driven framework
-> We can read data from configuration.properties
-> We can read data from feature files
-> We can read data from excel sheets

====================================================================================

TDD vs BDD

--> What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?

-> First tests are written
-> Tests are ran
-> Tests fail, because there is no code
-> Code implementation is done, just enough to pass the tests
-> Repeat, refactor

MVP --> Minimum viable product

--> What is Behavior Driven Development (BDD) ?

-> BDD is an extension of TDD. We use similar approach for development.
-> BUT there is a difference: Instead of writing tests, we write behaviors/scenario.
-> We create scenarios from the end-users perspective.
-> Gherkin language is used.

There are two sides of BDD.
1- Business side : FEATURE FILES
-> Where we write scenarios in Gherkin language; Given, When, Then, And, But, *
-> Understandable for non-technical team members
-> Everything runs in the order of the feature files

2- Implementation side : STEP DEFINITIONS
-> We create JAVA classes to implement actual JAVA+SELENIUM+JUNIT... code to make it synchronized with browser
-> Only for developers, SDETs
-> step definitions are just java methods
-> we should not change anything from the signature of the method

--> What is a Feature?
-> Agile stories, User stories

Normally -> From one agile story, you create many test cases.

In Feature file-> Usually that feature is one agile story.
-> Then you create different SCENARIOS from that feature file

--> What is a Scenario?
-> Each test case we create from a user story
-> We don't call them test cases, we call them 'scenarios'

--> What are steps?
-> Steps are how we create/re-create that scenario.
-> Each step is like a re-usable method
-> We write it once, and we call in anywhere in any feature file

Step by step how to create a scenario and implement it:
1- Create a new feature file. Named something.feature --> extension should .feature
2- Use Feature: keyword to define "agile story"
3- Use Scenario: keyword to create new scenario, and add brief explanation if needed
4- Using other Gherkin keywords such as Given, When, Then, And, But we create each step
5- AFTER WE ARE DONE WITH FEATURE FILE, we run our code from Runner class
6- This will generate us some auto generated SNIPPETS. (empty methods for us to implement)
7- Copy/paste snippets into step_definitions class
8- Implement java, selenium logic there

==============================================

#2 -> dryRun : just one keyword we pass into Runner class to allow our framework to
    RUN or NOT to RUN the actual code.

dryRun = true --> will not run the actual implementation of our code
-> it will just check the feature file steps against step definitions

dryRun = false --> will run our code

IF YOU ARE GETTING THIS--> io.cucumber.junit.SkippedThrowable: This scenario is skipped
CHECK DRYRUN VALUE.

================================================

MAC : COMMAND + CLICK TO STEP FROM FEATURE FILE WILL TAKE YOU TO STEP DEFINITION
WINDOWS : CONTROL + CLICK TO STEP FROM FEATURE FILE WILL TAKE YOU TO STEP DEFINITION

=============================

--> TAGS:

or : it will find any matching tag and run all of the given tags
    tags = "@librarian or @admin"
    tags = "@librarian or @student"
    tags = "@student or @admin"

and : it will run only if the scenario or feature file has all of the given tags
    -> whenever we use "and" keyword we are being more specific
    -> it expects all of the tags to be in that scenario to run it

        @librarian  and @employee ==> both should run

syntax:
tags = "@librarian and @employee"

not : is used to exclude any group of tags

tags = "@login and not @student" ==> will run everything inside of the login feature,
        except the scenario(s) that has @student tag

IF I want to only run student and librarian, what should my tags be?

tags = "@student or @librarian"

ex: @employee and @sunday and not @librarian

will run the scenarios that has both "@employee" and "@sunday" tags,
    and will exclude the scenarios that has "@librarian"

====================================================================

#4 -> Background:

-> If we have repeating steps for each scenario, we will write those repeating
        SETUP steps under background.
-> It will apply to all of the scenarios in the SAME feature file.
-> Very similar to @BeforeMethod in TestNG.
-> We are just putting the setup steps once, instead of repeating them many times
-> We can put more than one step under background

====================================================================

#5 -> Hooks:
- Hooks class is used to create pre and post condition for scenarios and even steps.
- @Before, @After tags coming from cucumber, that will be applying to each scenario
- @BeforeStep, @AfterStep tags, whatever we put will be applying to each STEP.


How the Hooks class is connected to the feature files?
- Hooks class needs to be created in step_definitions package
- CukesRunner contains glue="step defintions path"
- Whenever we create Hooks class with @Before/@After (imported from cucumber),
        it will automatically check the GLUE PATH.
- CukesRunner looks for the GLUE PATH for the HOOKS annotations.

---> Can we have more than one @Before and @After in one Hooks class?
- Yes, we can have more than one.
- By default it will check and run alphabetical order first.
- If both methods start with same letter it will run top to bottom

- WE CAN CHANGE RUNNING ORDER USING ===> "order" keyword
- The smaller the number, the earlier the method will run

---> The whole purpose of being able to have more than one BEFORE/AFTER is to be able
    to apply different conditions to different scenarios.

ex: Lets say we need to connect to database for only SOME of the scenarios.
- In this case, if I just have one BEFORE, it will apply to all of the scenarios.
- For this reason, we can create a separate Before where we do additional configuration
    specific to those few scenarios using tags.

---> BEFORESTEP :
-> This annotation will apply BEFORE each step

---> AFTERSTEP :
-> This annotation will apply AFTER each step

USE CASE: These two annotations could be useful for taking screenshots before and after each step
-> But that is not the only purpose of these annotations. You can do pretty much anything you want to do.

=============================================================================

#6 -> Parameterization

- Cucumber parameterization is being able to pass test data from feature files.
- Parameterization allows us to pass test data and run our scenarios on different data
 sets without having to go into code and change anything

1- #MAC : OPTION + ENTER --> ALLOWS YOU TO GENERATE STEP DEFINITIONS
#WINDOWS : ALT + ENTER --> ALLOWS YOU TO GENERATE STEP DEFINITIONS

2- Select create step definitions and PRESS ENTER
3- Select the class you want the step definitions to be added
